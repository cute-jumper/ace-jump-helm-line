*Ace-jump to a candidate in helm window.*

This package makes use of the =avy-jump.el= provided in [[https://github.com/abo-abo/ace-window/][ace-window]].

* Setup
  : (add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/ace-jump-helm-line.el")
  : (require 'ace-jump-helm-line)

  You can use the following code to bind =ace-jump-helm-line= (or
  =ace-jump-helm-line-execute-action=. See later) to a key(say, "C-'"):
  : (eval-after-load "helm"
  : '(define-key helm-map (kbd "C-'") 'ace-jump-helm-line))

* Usage
  When in a helm session, for example, after you call =helm-M-x=, you can use
  your key binding(for example, "C-'") to invoke =ace-jump-helm-line=. See the
  following demos.
  
  =ace-jump-helm-line= would just jump to that candidate in helm window. If you
  want to jump to and automatically select the candidate, which will then quit
  the helm session, you can bind the key to =ace-jump-helm-line-execute-action=.

* Demos
  Use =avy-jump= style to jump to a helm candidate:
  [[./screencasts/avy-jump-style.gif]]

  Or use =ace-jump-mode= style(which should be similar as [[https://github.com/winterTTr/ace-jump-mode][ace-jump-mode]]):
  [[./screencasts/ace-jump-mode-style.gif]]

  By default, this package uses =avy-jump= style(anyway, it uses
  =avy-jump.el=!). You can certainly change to =ace-jump-mode-style= by:
  : (setq ace-jump-helm-line-use-avy-style nil)
