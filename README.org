*Ace-jump to a candidate in helm window.*

This package makes use of the =avy.el=.

* Setup
  : (add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/ace-jump-helm-line.el")
  : (require 'ace-jump-helm-line)

  You can use the following code to bind =ace-jump-helm-line= (or
  =ace-jump-helm-line-execute-action=. See later) to a key(say, @@html:<kbd>@@C-'@@html:</kbd>@@):
  : (eval-after-load "helm"
  : '(define-key helm-map (kbd "C-'") 'ace-jump-helm-line))

* Usage
  When in a helm session, for example, after you call =helm-M-x=, you can use
  your key binding(for example, @@html:<kbd>@@C-'@@html:</kbd>@@) to invoke =ace-jump-helm-line=. See the
  following demos.

  Two commands are available:
  - =ace-jump-helm-line=: Jump to a candidate in helm window. You can still move
    around in the helm window after this command.
  - =ace-jump-helm-line-execute-action=: Jump to a candidate and automatically
    select the candidate to execute the persistent action. The helm session will
    end after this command.

* Demos
  Use =avy= style to jump to a helm candidate:
  [[./screencasts/avy-jump-style.gif]]

  Or use =ace-jump-mode= style(which should be similar as [[https://github.com/winterTTr/ace-jump-mode][ace-jump-mode]]):
  [[./screencasts/ace-jump-mode-style.gif]]

  By default, this package uses =avy= style(anyway, it uses =avy.el=!). You can
  certainly change to =ace-jump-mode-style= by:
  : (setq ace-jump-helm-line-use-avy-style nil)
