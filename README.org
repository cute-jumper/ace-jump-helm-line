#+TITLE: ace-jump-helm-line
*Ace-jump to a candidate in helm window.*

This package makes use of the =avy-jump.el= provided in [[https://github.com/abo-abo/ace-window/][ace-window]].

* Setup
  : (add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/ace-jump-helm-line.el")
  : (require 'ace-jump-helm-line)

* Demo
  Use =avy-jump= style to jump to a helm candidate:
  [[./screencasts/avy-jump-style.gif]]

  Or use =ace-jump-mode= style(which should be similar as [[https://github.com/winterTTr/ace-jump-mode][ace-jump-mode]]):
  [[./screencasts/ace-jump-mode-style.gif]]

  By default, this package uses =avy-jump= style(anyway, it uses
  =avy-jump.el=!). You can certainly change to =ace-jump-mode-style= by:
  : (setq ace-jump-helm-line-use-avy-style nil)
